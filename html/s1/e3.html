                        Gab rushed outside thoughts racing through his head. Ten miles in twenty minutes was definitely
                        impossible on foot. Unless, could he possibly? He turned his gaze towards the horse shed.

                        But then again, because he was "decent" he was stuck in a rut his entire life. He'd never taken
                        a risk.

                        He sprinted towards the shed and unlocked it. There were around seven horses inside belonging to
                        the attendees of the party. He strode over to the one standing last and whispered.

                        Gab stood as still as a statue as he heard mismatching footsteps matching towards the stable. If
                        he was caught... He'd be imprisoned for life (punishment for thievery was very strict here). He
                        quickly mounted the horse and it began neighing immediately.

                        The horse had collided with the drunkard and thrown him flat on his back. The horse galloped
                        away and Gab couldn't believe what he just did. He stole a horse and knocked over a man! Talk
                        about being stuck in a rut! Gab knew he was a drunk because when he knocked him down the man
                        gasped and Gab got a face full of beer breath and heard the sound of a bottle shattering.
                        <br><br>
                        He had no time to stop and help him as there was an adventure to be had. Also the adrenaline was
                        practically making him feel the most alive than he had ever felt. He directed the horse
                        southwards. Gab remembered that Colly said he would be close after he passed a pile of rocks
                        (rockarena).
                        <br><br>
                        Sure enough in five minutes, he passed a huge cavern. He wondered whether the myths were true
                        about the cavern being haunted. He peered into it as he passed and by the moonlight could just
                        make out the silhouettes of giants rocks. No one knew how they got there in the first place.

                        After a few more minutes he smelt smoke and saw a tiny hut far away. He could just make out the
                        shadow of a huge man in the window. <br>
                        He galloped up the muddy path and stopped a few metres from the yard. <br>
                        A man seemed to be waiting for him in the doorway and even though it was a partially moonlit
                        night, Gab was sure whoever this was, he was easily seven to eight feet tall.

                        Gab approached the door as the man beckoned to follow him inside. The hut was very cozy. There
                        was a fire burning merrily and a sweet aroma of coffee was in the air. There was a big display
                        of assorted snacks including the sausage roll he ate earlier.

We were the closest friends in the world and we took a trip for 3 years to Kensington. By the age of 21, Gaveen was crowned king, and he was the most ruthless ruler we'd ever seen. So one day your dad and I made a plan to take him down. We planned to poison the goods in the horse carriage that was set for the palace. The King suspected someone was plotting against him and always had his food tested. The poison didn't work. The horse carriage driver ratted your dad out and your dad was traced back to PunkLand one week later, caught and imprisoned. I managed to break him out two days later almost getting caught myself. I tried to persuade him to come with me to PunkLand but he refused. He said he couldn't leave the people. Your dad is a noble man, Gab. I tried to break into Kensington many times to communicate with him but the border is heavily fortified. I had a billion questions but didn't want to write to him incase it drew too much attention. Not like I even knew where he was. He would send me a letter once every 3 months letting me know everything is okay but advising not to write back.<br><br>Now the day before that man was found your dad sent me a letter by eagle. He never used an eagle before. We used to play this game when we were younger. If one of us gave a different kind of clue or message, it means that they were expecting an answer back. He told me about Sawant coming to PunkLand to pass on the burden to someone else.</p>
