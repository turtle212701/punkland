                        As dawn struck the following day, Gab was extremely exhausted. As he left his post for his
                        substitute to
                        take over, he wondered whether the unconscious man was awake. He also thought about how lonely
                        his
                        routine was. It was the same act everyday. Wake at 8pm, change out of the flowery pyjamas his
                        mom
                        gifted
                        him before she passed away, change into the shining denim armour, eat breakfast (or rather
                        dinner)
                        and
                        climb the spiralling stairs to his post at the top of the west tower. He was suddenly jolted out
                        of
                        his
                        stupur by the sound of a loud.... something.
                        <br><br>
                        He looked up at the sky and was immediately blinded by the dazzling sunlight. Straining his
                        eyes, he
                        noticed a majestic, bald eagle flying towards him. He quickly pulled out his makeshift periscope
                        (No, it
                        wasn't to spy on girls!) and poised it towards the speck flying towards him. He spotted it
                        carrying
                        a
                        scroll and a pouch as it made its way towards him. He lifted his heavily gloved forearm and the
                        eagle
                        perched itself on it. He took the scroll from its talons and unraveled it, to reveal a message
                        scrawled
                        in terrible handwriting.

                        On reading this, Gab was flustered. Who was this Remy and why did he want too meet him? He
                        pondered
                        these questions as he opened the pouch. There was a sausage roll inside, stuffed and greasy.

                    <p>
                        He split the roll with the eagle still wondering why Remy, whoever he was, sent him the scroll
                        with
                        the
                        appointment. With a great 'Ca-Caw!' the eagle took off jolting him out of his daydream yet
                        again.
                        <br> <br>
                        Gab fell asleep almost as soon as he reached his chambers. As he slumbered off he dreamt he was
                        riding
                        on the eagles back looking for unknown men wearing sausage rolls for clothes all of them
                        shouting
                        'Remy!'

                        Gab shuddered to consciousness with a start. His shirt was drenched entirely with sweat and he

                        breathing irregularly.

                        Asrea Weston was a Scottish singer born in Scotland but brought up in France. Gab was a big fan
                        of her
                        work. She sang in the 2019 'Brit Carson prixton' stealing the first place from Friedason
                        Jackrabbit. She
                        also performed on Punkland's got talent and Punklandian Idol. Not to mention, her looks were off

                        Colly and Gab strolled through the castle doors and we're out in the cool night breeze. It was
                        half
                        past
                        ten. They made their way to the midnight mermaid performance hall by the fallen tower. The
                        MMPH is
                        an
                        18th century stadium constructed by Emporer Raul Nat. It was almost in ruins by the present day.
                        But
                        the then
                        King of PunkLand, Jake Hamburg decided to convert it into a performance hall. Much of the
                        construction
                        was ancient but the thatched roof was modern.
                        <br> <br>
                        The duo entered the hall and proceeded towards the center left where they looked for their
                        seats. In
                        about ten minutes the lights dimmed as the curtains were drawn. A bright beam of light shone
                        from
                        the
                        back onto a woman on stage.

                        on
                        her head walked on stage. Little did anyone know that Gab was having a hard time trying not to

                        out

                        Sure enough, all heads were turned towards the two of them. Some people were laughing
                        and
                        others nodding in agreement to what Gab had just shouted. Slowly they turned back to the stage
                        where,
                        Asrea had begun her performance. <br><br>

                        Gab forgot all about the recent embarrassment, the unknown man and everything else. He just
                        melted
                        in
                        along with everyone else to Asrea's beautiful voice. The song was so mesmerizing that in no
                        time,
                        Asrea
                        was
                        saying thank-you and moving off stage. Gab wasn't the only one who stood and clapped the
                        loudest.
                        Although he shouldn't have done that.
                        <br><br>
                        You see Gab had forgotten to take his sword off when he changed, and when he stood to applaud,
                        the
                        hilt
                        poked an old man in the front row in the back of his head. The partially blind man turned around
                        to
                        see
                        what had hit him.

                        The spotlight flashed on Gab blinding him for a full five seconds. It was the longest five
                        seconds
                        of
                        his life as everyone had seen his sword (For REAL, His SWORD!)
                        <br><br>
                        People were heard screaming, a few wolf whistled and Colly was laughing his head off.
                        Embarrassed,
                        Gab
                        ran to the restroom were he tried to unhinge the sword simultaneously trying to smooth out his
                        appearance (He had turned 'tomato and hot sauce on samosa red')
                        <br><br>
                        There was an interval before the next act, so he emerged from the restroom and began to look for
                        colly.
                        He found him near the bar and joined him.

                        Gab looks at the clock and almost chokes on his drink. It was twenty minutes to midnight! He was
