                    <p class="commentary">
                        Long ago in a land almost but not quite far away there was a kingdom called PunkLand.

                        This kingdom was completely cut of from the outside world. The people worked hard, and were
                        guided
                        by a good ruler. The people shared whatever they had with each other and lived happy lives.
                        <br> <br>
                        One day, one of the king's soldiers was doing his rounds by the lake when he came across a man
                        lying
                        unconsious on the gravel. He was wearing what looked like a rag and had scars all over his body.
                        Whoever
                        this man was, he was badly beat up by someone. His left eye was purple and swollen and he had a
                        deep
                        cut
                        on
                        his cheek.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, every soldier had a foghorn that he'd use if he was in trouble or if there was some kind of
                        emergency.
                        He blew his horn (No pun intended!) and a group of four more soldiers arrived on their horses
                        after
                        short
                        while.
                    </p>

                        it
                        into his chambers and continued on his rounds.

                        That night as Gab got up to prepare for his shift, he noticed a little slip of pink paper at the
                        bottom
                        of
                        his door. Sprinting out of bed and regretting it later (His leg cramped), He opened the note
                        hoping it
                        was
                        from some girl in the castle. To his dismay, it was his idiot of a guy friend!
