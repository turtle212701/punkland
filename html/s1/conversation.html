                        <p>"Gab, don't go off with the idea that he was a coward. He left with me to take down Gaveen. You see I knew your father since I was a little boy. We were the closest friends in the world and we took a trip for 3 years to Kensington. By the age of 21, Gaveen was crowned king, and he was the most ruthless ruler we'd ever seen. So one day your dad and I made a plan to take him down. We planned to poison the goods in the horse carriage that was set for the palace. The King suspected someone was plotting against him and always had his food tested. The poison didn't work. The horse carriage driver ratted your dad out and your dad was traced back to PunkLand one week later, caught and imprisoned. I managed to break him out two days later almost getting caught myself. I tried to persuade him to come with me to PunkLand but he refused. He said he couldn't leave the people. Your dad is a noble man, Gab. I tried to break into Kensington many times to communicate with him but the border is heavily fortified. I had a billion questions but didn't want to write to him incase it drew too much attention. Not like I even knew where he was. He would send me a letter once every 3 months letting me know everything is okay but advising not to write back.<br><br>Now the day before that man was found your dad sent me a letter by eagle. He never used an eagle before. We used to play this game when we were younger. If one of us gave a different kind of clue or message, it means that they were expecting an answer back. He told me about Sawant coming to PunkLand to pass on the burden to someone else.</p>
